# Media Posting App with Django
This repository is a practice application that is under construction. It is an attempt at learning the Django library from top to bottom.

Here is a list of things I plan to do, or have done, with this project:
- [x] Basic login/logout system
- [] Make posts with images
- [] Follow users and see their posts
- [] Make comments on posts
- [x] See all users
- [x] See user profiles
- [] Edit own user profile
- [] Remember the rest of things I want to do

For the curious, this can be run by 
1. Creating a virtual environment and activating it
2. Installing the dependencies in the requirements.txt `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Migrating with `python manage.py migrate` so that the database is functional
4. Running the django app with `python manage.py runserver`.
